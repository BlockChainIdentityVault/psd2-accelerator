== Building Block View

=== Whitebox Overall System

image:generated/whitebox-1.png["Whitebox Overall System Level 1",60%]

Motivation::

The application is designed as a modular monolith and uses Spring Boot 1.5. Every independent feature maps to a top level package (`de.adorsys.psd2.sandbox.certgen`) (backend) or a top level folder (`src/app/certgen`) (UI). The UI is
implemented as an Angular app and bundled in the backend JAR.


Contained Building Blocks::

| **Name**              | **Responsibility**

| certificate-generator
| Create QWAC certificates to enable access to the XS2A API

| config
| Configure the Sandbox and XS2A API (e.g. supported payment products). Just a https://todo-link-to-file[yaml] file right now.

| documentation
| Provide documentation about the API (e.g. OpenAPI), supported use cases (XS2A), getting started and examples in one place

| testdata              | Generate, import and manage test data accessible over the XS2A API
| xs2a                  | Provides the actual XS2A REST API

| **Name**              | **Responsibility**

| PIS
| Provide the Payment Initiation Service implementation for XS2A (implements interface from `xs2a-impl`). Uses the _testdata_ module for the actual values.

| AIS
| Provide the Account Initiation Service implementation for XS2A (implements interface from `xs2a-impl`). Uses the _testdata_ module for the actual values.

| PIIS
| Provide the Payment Issuer Instruments implementation for XS2A (implements interface from `xs2a-impl`). Uses the _testdata_ module for the actual values.

| profile (library)
| Expose the XS2A configuration via REST API. The actual values come from the top level _config_ module. Is provided by the `profile` library from XS2A and embedded in our sandbox. Needed by `xs2a-impl` and not directly called by us.

Part of the https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a[adorsys PSD2 XS2A implementation].

| consent-management (library)
| Handle consents for us. Every payment or account information needs/creates a consent. Is
provided by the `consent-management` library from XS2A and embedded in our sandbox.

Part of the https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a[adorsys PSD2 XS2A implementation].

| xs2a-impl (library)
| Provide the XS2A business implementation (e.g. validation, handling of consents via `consent-management`). Calls our own `AIS`/`PIS`/`PIIS` implementations.

Part of the https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a[adorsys PSD2 XS2A implementation].
