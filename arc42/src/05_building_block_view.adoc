=== Whitebox Overall System

Motivation::

The application is designed as a modular monolith and uses Spring Boot 1.5. Every independent feature "xyz" maps to a top level package (`de.adorsys.psd2.sandbox.xyz`) (backend) or a top level folder (`src/app/xyz`) (UI). The UI is
implemented as an Angular app and bundled at build time in the backend JAR. The PSD2 Accelerator consists of the _sandbox_ and the _ssl-proxy_.


Contained Building Blocks::

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name**              | **Responsibility**

| certificate-generator
| Create QWAC certificates to allow TPPs access to the XS2A API via <<SSL Client Authentication>>

| developer-portal
| Provide documentation about the API (e.g. OpenAPI), supported use cases (XS2A), getting started and examples in one place. The content is static but embedded in the Angular app.

| ssl-proxy
| Infrastructure component which does SSL termination and SSL Client Authentication for XS2A. The ssl-proxy forwards the SSL Client certificate to XS2A. Since the ssl-proxy is part of the infrastructure, the actual implementation varies. Our own PSD2 Accelerator deployment uses our bundled NGINX (which also acts as reverse proxy). Customers may substitute it with their own hard- or software solution (HA-Proxy, F5, ...).

| xs2a                  | Provides the actual XS2A REST API

| config
| Configure the PSD2 Accelerator and XS2A API (e.g. supported payment products). Just a https://github.com/adorsys/psd2-accelerator/blob/master/service/src/main/resources/bank_profile.yml[YAML] file right now.

| testdata              | Manages static test data and allows some configuration.

|===
| **Name**              | **Responsibility**

| PIS
| Provide the Payment Initiation Service implementation for XS2A (implements interface from `xs2a-impl`). Uses the _testdata_ module for the actual values.

| AIS
| Provide the Account Initiation Service implementation for XS2A (implements interface from `xs2a-impl`). Uses the _testdata_ module for the actual values.

| PIIS
| Provide the Payment Issuer Instruments implementation for XS2A (implements interface from `xs2a-impl`). Uses the _testdata_ module for the actual values.

| profile (library)
| Expose the XS2A configuration via REST API. The actual values come from the top level _config_ module. Is provided by the `profile` library from XS2A and embedded in our sandbox. Needed by `xs2a-impl` and not directly called by us.

Part of the https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a[adorsys PSD2 XS2A implementation].

| consent-management (library)
| Handle consents for us. Every payment or account information needs/creates a consent. Is
provided by the `consent-management` library from XS2A and embedded in our sandbox.

Part of the https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a[adorsys PSD2 XS2A implementation].

| xs2a-impl (library)
| Provide the XS2A business implementation (e.g. validation, handling of consents via `consent-management`). Calls our own `AIS`/`PIS`/`PIIS` implementations.
