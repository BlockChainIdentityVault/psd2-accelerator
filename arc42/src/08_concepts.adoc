== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Definition of Done

* Code is technically reviewed by the developer
* Code is manually tested
* Pipeline is running green
** All existing tests are still working
** Code Styling is followed
** Branch is rebased and therefore ready to merge
* Automatic test for new functionality is implemented (if applicable)
* Documentation is updated (if applicable)

=== Supported Browsers

Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge will be officially supported.
Regarding w3schools.com, these browsers are the most popular browsers of 2018.
Those browser together have a market share of https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/[roughly 95%].
Only the latest versions of the listed browsers are officially supported.
Currently no support for mobile devices is planned.

=== Code Formatting

For this project we decided to use two different code stylings depending on frontend or backend
development.

The frontend development is using the default Angular code style checked by https://github.com/palantir/tslint[tslint].
The appropriate `tslint.json` can be found in the `ui` folder.
To guarantee a clean code styling on the remote branch, we decided to add a pre-push-hook which
checks the style for errors and if possible also fixes them automatically. Furthermore, we added
a second check embedded in the ci pipeline which fails in case of unclean code.

The backend development (mostly Java code) is using the https://github.com/google/styleguide[Google Code Style] which can
be found in the `service` folder named `google-checkstyle.xml`. After adding this file to the local
IDE the automatic styling should apply to those rules. We decided to add a `maven-checkstyle-plugin`
which allows the code style check during the build process. The configuration for this plugin is based on
the `google-checkstyle.xml` which can also be found in the `service` folder of this project.
In case of unformatted code the ci pipeline will fail with an appropriate error message.
