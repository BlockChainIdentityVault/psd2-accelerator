== Introduction and Goals

=== Introduction

The https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366&from=EN[Payment Service
Directive 2 (PSD2)] instructs banks to provide a fully productive Access-to-Account (XS2A) interface
to Third Party Provider (TPPs) until September 2019.
XS2A itself consists of banking services to initiate payments (PIS), request account data (AIS) and
get the confirmation of the availability of funds (PIIS).
In order to guarantee the compliance of this deadline due to adaptions and bugs, PSD2 claims the
banks to provide a functional sandbox offering the XS2A services in a non-productive environment
until March 2019.


==== Details about PSD2

PSD2 is aiming to open banks to TPPs in a harmonized and high secure manner. A reason for passing
this directive is to innovate banking applications by introducing new non-banking players and make
banking more attractive to the end consumer.

PSD2 itself is an EU directive describing requirements for banks on a very high level embedded in
law paragraphs. The document contains links to Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) prescribing
technical descriptions like the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Those documents are very
abstract and still close to the law which is a great challenge to interpret them correctly.

The Berlin-Group Initiative https://www.berlin-group.org/[NextGenPSD2] joint forces to create an
open specification of the XS2A to harmonize this interface. Amongst NextGenPSD2 a few other players
like https://www.openbanking.org.uk/about-us/[OpenBanking] and https://www.stet.eu/en/psd2/[STET]
are aiming to achieve the same goals.


==== Sandbox Project

As described previously, the PSD2 Sandbox must provide an XS2A interface as a central component. In
case of this project, the interface meets the requirements of the Berlin Group (Version 1.2) and is
based on test data.
Besides the actual interface, PSD2 instructs banks to offer a technical documentation free of charge
containing amongst others, information about supported payment products and payment services.

Usually, before accessing the XS2A services a TPP would need to register at its National Competent
Authority (NCA) and request an
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN[eIDAS] certificate
at an appropriate Trust Service Provider (TSP).
Issuing a real certificate just for testing purposes would be a bit too much effort, which is why
this sandbox is additionally simulating a fictional TSP issuing Qualified Website Authentication
Certificates (QWAC). A QWAC is part of eIDAS and might be better known as
https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3739.txt[X.509] certificate.
For PSD2-purposes the certificate gets extended by the QcStatement containing appropriate values
such as the role(s) of the PSP (see
https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/119495/01.01.02_60/ts_119495v010102p.pdf[ETSI]).

After embedding the QWAC in the actual XS2A request, the role and the signature get validated at a
central reverse proxy before it gets finally passed to the interface where the banking logic
happens. The technical documentation of the XS2A interface can be accessed
https://psd2-sandbox-dev.cloud.adorsys.de/swagger-ui.html[here].

The *PSD2 Sandbox* project bundles the described PSD2 components created at adorsys. The project is
a self contained application which enables customers to provide a PSD2 compliant API for testing.
The highlevel architecture is displayed in the following Figure.

=== Requirements Overview

The PSD2 Sandbox is an application that aims to fulfill the following requirements:

* Get banks compliant to the law in March 2019
* Be easily deployable on the banks existing infrastructure
* Be configurable to match the business features bank
* Make the technical documentation of the XS2A interface accessible
* Allow TPPs to test services based on test data
* QWAC (certificate for authentication as specified in https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/119495/01.01.02_60/ts_119495v010102p.pdf[ETSI], https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN[eIDAS]) can be issued by the TPP itself and used as in the real world


=== Quality Goals

[options="header"]
|===
| Quality Goal       | Scenario
| PSD2 Compliance    |
The sandbox must be PSD2 compliant. Neither ease of use or cool technologies help the user if they fail the audit
because of us.
| Fast Onboarding    |
As a potential user of the sandbox you should be able to get the application running within minutes. We need to provide good documentation, sensible defaults and a simple setup.
| Simple Deployment  |
The sandbox should be easy to deploy in enterprise contexts. This requires a simple architecture
(e.g. not too many deployments, proven technology) and good documentation.
