## Tools Used for Diagrams

We use https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] for simple diagrams. This allow us to put the plain text
diagram sources under source control. PlantUML diagrams are put into the `diagrams` folder and
are named `*.puml`. At build time we generate PNGs from them and put them in the ignored folder
`images/generated`.

More complex diagrams (like the diagram in <<SSL Client Authentication>>) are created with https://draw.io, which is now completely free and even offers a https://about.draw.io/integrations[desktop app]. draw.io diagrams are saved as XML, also put in the `diagrams` folder and have the
extension `*.drawio.xml` (convention for us). We *manually* export them to `images/*.svg`.
