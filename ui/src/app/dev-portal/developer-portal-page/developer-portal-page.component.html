    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
      <div>
        PSD2 instructs banks to provide a fully productive XS2A interface till September 2019.
        In order to guarantee the compliance of this deadline due to adaptions and bugs, PSD2
        claims the banks to provide a functional sandbox offering the XS2A services in a
        non-productive environment.
        One requirement of the sandbox is the possibility to authenticate Payment Service
        Providers (PSP) using eIDAS Certificates. Those certificates usually get issued by
        appropriate Trusted Service Providers (TSP) which are working in cooperation with the
        National Competent Authoritiy (NCA).
        Issuing a real certificate just for testing purposes would be a bit too much effort,
        which is why this application is simulating a fictional TSP issuing Qualified Website
        Authentication Certificates (QWAC). A QWAC is part of eIDAS and might be better known
        as X.509 certificate. For PSD2-purposes the certificate gets extended by the QCStatement
        containing appropriate values such as the role(s) of the PSP.
