# Nginx SSL Proxy

## Getting started

### Create CA certificate

Create the key for the CA

`openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096 ` 

With this key you can create the certificate for the CA. Leave **Common Name (CN)** empty, because it can cause errors. **Email** can be omitted.

`openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt`


### Create the client certificate signing request
Create the key for the client.
A number of questions will be asked; answer each one, including the Common Name (CN) and email address.
The CSR thatâ€™s created would be sent to the CA (an administrator, but in this case probably also yourself) to be signed.

`openssl genrsa -des3 -out user.key 4096`

With the key you can create the certificate signing request (CSR) file:

`openssl req -new -key user.key -out user.csr`

### Sign the client certificate signing request with the CA cert

`openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in user.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out user.crt`

### Export the PKCS file from the client cert
PKCS (PFX) is used to import the certificate in web browsers. So we have to export our **.crt** file to a **.pfx** file.

`openssl pkcs12 -export -out user.pfx -inkey user.key -in user.crt -certfile ca.crt`

You will be asked to supply an export password.

### Create the nginx certificate

`openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout nginx.key -out nginx.pem`

### Create a password file for your nginx cert
