# Sandbox SSL, SSL Client Auth and CA Setup

## Create CA certificate

Create the key for the CA

```sh
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096
```

With this key you can create the certificate for the CA. Leave **Common Name (CN)** empty, because it can cause errors. **Email** can be omitted.

```sh
$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
```

## Create the client certificate signing request

Create the key for the client.
A number of questions will be asked; answer each one, including the Common Name (CN) and email address.
The CSR thatâ€™s created would be sent to the CA (an administrator, but in this case probably also yourself) to be signed.

```sh
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out user.key 4096
```

With the key you can create the certificate signing request (CSR) file:

```sh
$ openssl req -new -key user.key -out user.csr
```

## Sign the client certificate signing request with the CA cert

```sh
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in user.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out user.crt
```

## Export the PKCS file from the client cert

PKCS (PFX) is used to import the certificate in web browsers. So we have to export our **.crt** file to a **.pfx** file.

```sh
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -out user.pfx -inkey user.key -in user.crt -certfile ca.crt
```

You will be asked to supply an export password.

## Create a self signed SSL certificate for nginx

NOTE: this is for testing - you can skip this step if you already have a proper SSL certificate

```sh
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout nginx.key -out nginx.pem
```

## Create a password file for your SSL certificate key

The directive [ssl_password_file](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_password_file) is used to
set the required SSL certificate key password. Create a file containing your passphrase and copy it to
`/opt/app-root/etc/global.pass`.

```sh
$ grep -i ssl_password_file /opt/app-root/etc/nginx.default.d/sandbox-server.conf
ssl_certificate /opt/app-root/etc/nginx.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /opt/app-root/etc/nginx.key;
ssl_password_file /opt/app-root/etc/global.pass;
[...]

$ cat /opt/app-root/etc/global.pass
supersecurepassword
```
